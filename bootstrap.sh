#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bootstrap.sh - one-time setup for a fresh container so the rest of the
# claude-shared workflow can be installed.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# claude-shared/install.sh assumes three things are already in place:
#   1. gh (GitHub CLI) installed and on PATH
#   2. gh authed against github.com with read access to your fork
#   3. claude CLI logged in
# A brand-new container has none of those. This script handles 1+2+3 in
# one shot. After it finishes you can clone your claude-shared fork and
# run its install.sh.
#
# Where to keep this file
# -----------------------
# The Dockerfile that builds your container probably lives in a separate
# repo. This script is version-controlled here so it has a canonical home;
# copy or vendor it into the Dockerfile-owning project as needed.
#
# When to run
# -----------
# Once, inside a running container, the first time you want to set up Claude
# Code + claude-shared in that container. Safe to re-run: each step skips
# itself if already done.
#
# How to run
# ----------
#   bash bootstrap.sh
#
# After it finishes (replace OWNER with your GitHub username and REPO with
# your fork's name):
#   git clone https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git ~/claude-shared
#   CLAUDE_SHARED_OWNER=OWNER CLAUDE_SHARED_REPO_NAME=REPO ~/claude-shared/install.sh
#
# Assumptions
# -----------
# - Debian/Ubuntu base image (uses apt-get + dpkg).
# - claude CLI already on PATH (installed by the Dockerfile, not here).
